 *   - `weightFare` — ParcelConfig.weightCharge (₹/kg) × the package weight.
 *   - `courierCharge` — what the SELECTED courier company charges to actually
 *     ship the parcel from the pickup city to the destination city, looked up
 *     from the admin's Excel-uploaded rate card (see models/parcelCityRate.js
 *     and controller/parcelController.js). Passed in already resolved; this
 *     function does not do the lookup itself.
 *
 * Distance and delivery speed no longer affect price.
 * `distanceFare`/`platformCharge`/`companyCharge`/`expressCharge` are kept at
 * zero rather than removed from the shape, since fareBreakdown on the Parcel
 * model and the invoice/report code that reads it still expect those keys.
